### 1. Ensure You Have Node.js
Before starting, you need to have **Node.js** installed (it's what makes the app work).

### 3. Open a Terminal (Console)
*   On **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter.
*   On **Windows**: Press the `Start` key, type "PowerShell" or "CMD", and press Enter.

### 4. Enter the Project Folder
Type `cd` followed by a space, and drag the folder you unzipped into the terminal. It should look something like this:
```bash
cd /Users/your-name/Desktop/CopyPasteFriend
```
(Then press **Enter**)

### 5. Install Dependencies
